## Test Driven Development
This branch's sole purpose is to rebuild the Quote API using test driven development for the server side only. 

I used the codebase with the completed project, and as first commit, removed all the server code for a fresh start.

## General Information
This is a practice lab from the [Back-end Engineer path on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/back-end-engineer-career-path). The course teaches all the major technologies and skills that a back-end engineer needs to know.

This project comes after completing 30% of the course.

## Project Description
This project is a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology.

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js

## Setup
In order to run the program, you need to install Node.js on your computer:
* [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) the binaries
* If you use Linux, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation#how-to-install-nodejs-via-binary-archive-on-linux).

Once installed, install the program's dependencies with `npm install` in your terminal with the project's folder as working directory.

You can then start the Express server by typing `node server.js`.

## Running the app
Once you have the server up and running, you can launch the app in your browser by vising the URL `http://localhost:4001/`

The frontend contains actions for accessing all of the exposed endpoints from the backend server.
